Agency and EDU organizations can create and update sites from a common codebase using a Private Upstream, which can be selected by members of an organization during site creation. If you donâ€™t have a [Pantheon for Agencies](https://pantheon.io/agencies/pantheon-for-agencies) or [EDU](https://pantheon.io/edu) account you can create one for free.

## Benefits

### Standardize Design and Functionality Across Many Sites
Private Upstreams act as a scaffold for new sites, allowing developers and site owners of any skill level the ability kickoff projects at warp speed.

Instead of repeating the same technical work on each individual site, you can build and maintain a common user interface with unified branding and functionality once from a single source.

Learn how the web team at Weill Cornell Medical College used Private Upstreams to rescue 100+ websites from design anarchy in [this case study](https://pantheon.io/resources/weill-cornell-drupal-distribution-case-study).

### Efficient Update Strategy
Not only does this workflow free up developer time, it establishes a sustainable and scalable process for handling updating across massive site portfolios.

New features and functionality can be continuously developed in the Private Upstream repository overtime then distributed to each individual site where they can be applied with a single click by site owners:

See how Forum One uses this process to build, launch, and manage nearly 200 satellite sites for Fairfax County Public Schools in [this case study](https://pantheon.io/resources/forum-one-pantheon-fairfax-county-public-schools-drupal-case-study).

### Scale Client Services
Spend less time doing non-core activities and reclaim lost billable hours where it counts most. Private Upstreams help improve support efficiency by empowering non-technical clients and junior developers to handle lower-level support issues, such as creating a new site or applying updates. This gives advanced developers more time to focus on higher-level support work and new features.

Hear from Mike Pirog of [Kalamuna](http://www.kalamuna.com/) how this process liberates developers and empowers newbies to provide ridiculously awesome support in [this case study](https://pantheon.io/resources/kalamuna-pantheon-drupal-agency-case-study).


## Terminology
Let's agree on definitions for some commonly used terms:

* **Upstream**: An additional repository that acts as a parent for another repository, like [Pantheon's WordPress Upstream](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress).
* **Private Upstream**: Repository that is restricted to members of an organization which contains a common codebase for new sites. This type of repository is a child repository to Pantheon's core upstreams ([WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress), [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8), [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7)) and acts as a parent for site level repositories.
* **Public Upstream**: Repository that is open to all Pantheon users which contains a common codebase for new sites, like [Panopoly](https://github.com/populist/panopoly-drops-7).
* **Repository**: Collection of files that are packaged in a single directory.
* **Remote Repository**: Collection of files that are stored in a remote and central location.
* **Upstream Updates**: Code changes that are made once in the parent repository, then applied "downstream" to child repositories. This is how Pantheon's one-click updates work.
* **Site Level Repository**: Child repository where upstream updates are applied and site specific customizations are tracked, like your site's codebase on Pantheon.

## Workflow Overview
There are three levels of repositories in play here, and updates flow "downstream" from one level to another. Here's an example workflow for a Private Upstream based on WordPress:

![WordPress Private Upstream Example Flow](/source/docs/assets/images/upstream-flow.png)

### Level One: Pantheon's Core Upstream
The top level repository will be one of Pantheon's core upstreams (either [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress), [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8), or [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7)). Core upstream updates are distributed by Pantheon and must be applied downstream.

### Level Two: Your Private Upstream
The second level repository is a Private Upstream, where core updates from Pantheon are pulled in and modifications to your common codebase are distributed (e.g. parent theme and plugin/module version updates).

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">Maintainer(s) of Private Upstreams bear the responsibility of pulling in core updates from Pantheon. Failure to run the most up-to-date version of core based on upstreams maintained by Pantheon ([WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress), [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7), and [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8)) may cause incompatibilities with the platform (e.g. clear cache button, launch checks, cron, etc.).</p>
</div>

### Level Three: Site Codebase
Finally, core updates and changes to the common codebase make their way down to the site level repository for each site that uses the Private Upstream. The site level repository allows separation between common code across all sites, tracked in the Private Upstream, and site specific customizations, tracked in each individual site and facilitates rolling out updates quickly and easily:

## Connect a Private Upstream with Pantheon
The following steps will help you get a Private Upstream ready for prime time within your organization. Once completed, members of the organization will be able to create new sites from the common codebase.

### Create and Host the Repository Remotely
Private Upstream repositories must be hosted outside of Pantheon using a provider like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

This remote repository serves as the central location for the development and maintenance of your Private Upstream. Updates are tracked here and distributed downstream to sites within your organization.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p markdown="1">Private Upstreams must not contain the tags `pantheon_test_n` or `pantheon_live_n`. Pantheon site level repositories use these tags to deploy code to Test and Live environments.</p>
</div>

You can start by creating an empty repository on your preferred git hosting provider, or you can use an existing repository. Once you have the repository hosted remotely, clone it to your local. For help getting started, check out [GitHub's Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).


### Grant Pantheon Access (Privately Hosted Repositories Only)
For privately hosted repositories, create a dedicated user with read-only access to the repository. The password should only contain alphanumeric characters.

For private GitLab repositories, please ensure the user has the ["reporter" permissions level](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/permissions.html#permissions).


If your repository is publicly accessible, you can skip this step.

### Pull in Core from Pantheon's Upstream
To avoid incompatibilities, it's highly recommended that you track Pantheon's corresponding upstream repository within the Private Upstream.

Navigate to the Private Upstream's root directory using the command line, then add the appropriate Pantheon upstream as a [remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote):
<!-- Nav tabs -->
<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li id="wptab1" role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#wp1" aria-controls="wp1" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">WordPress</a></li>
  <li id="d8tab1" role="presentation"><a href="#d81" aria-controls="d81" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal 8</a></li>
  <li id="d7tab1" role="presentation"><a href="#d71" aria-controls="d71" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal 7</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- Tab panes -->
<div class="tab-content">
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="wp1">
<pre id="git-pull-wp"><code class="command nohighlight" data-lang="bash">git remote add pantheon-wordpress git://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress.git</code></pre>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="d81">
<pre id="git-pull-drops-8"><code class="command nohighlight" data-lang="bash">git remote add pantheon-drops-8 git://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8.git</code></pre>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="d71">
<pre id="git-pull-drops-7"><code class="command nohighlight" data-lang="bash">git remote add pantheon-drops-7 git://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div><br>

Now that the Private Upstream repository is tracking the corresponding Pantheon core upstream, we can pull in core:
<!-- Nav tabs -->
<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li id="wptab" role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#wp" aria-controls="wp" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">WordPress</a></li>
  <li id="d8tab" role="presentation"><a href="#d8" aria-controls="d8" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal 8</a></li>
  <li id="d7tab" role="presentation"><a href="#d7" aria-controls="d7" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal 7</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- Tab panes -->
<div class="tab-content">
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="wp">
<pre id="git-pull-wp"><code class="command nohighlight" data-lang="bash">git checkout master
git fetch pantheon-wordpress
git merge pantheon-wordpress/master
git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="d8">
<pre id="git-pull-drops-8"><code class="command nohighlight" data-lang="bash">git checkout master
git fetch pantheon-drops-8
git merge pantheon-drops-8/master
git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="d7">
<pre id="git-pull-drops-7"><code class="command nohighlight" data-lang="bash">git checkout master
git fetch pantheon-drops-7
git merge pantheon-drops-7/master
git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

## Pro Tips for Private Upstreams
### WordPress
* Reusable parent theme and branding
* Recommended Plugins:
  * [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/)
  * [Pantheon HUD](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-hud/)
  * [WP Native PHP Sessions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-native-php-sessions/)
  * [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/)
  * [WP-CFM](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cfm/) - Use this plugin to manage configurations in code. Even better, [add a must-use plugin to modify WP-CFM's path for configuration files](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples/tree/master/wp_cfm_import#hiding-configuration-files) so they're not web accessible.
### Drupal 8
* Reusable theme and branding
* Recommended Modules:
